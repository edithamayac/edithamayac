Hi 👋 I’m Edith Amaya, a Business Intelligence Analyst with over 10 years of experience in hospitality and administrative operations. My background taught me how to analyze processes and communicate across teams. Today, I use tools like Tableau, SQL, and Excel to analyze and visualize data, improve workflows, and support decision-making.

🌱 I’m passionate about travel and hospitality, helping people, technology, and meaningful data storytelling, using analytics to help organizations make responsible and impactful decisions.

#✨ Fun facts about me:

• I studied Tourism and Hospitality Management in Colombia 🇨🇴 where I am from!
• I live in sunny Los Angeles, California, with my husband and our big black-and-white husky mix, Luna 🐾.
• I love nature, travel, and photography 📸
